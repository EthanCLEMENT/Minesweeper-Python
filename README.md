# Minesweeper-Python
Minesweeper game in python. I use the libraries numpy to iterate through all the squares and tkinter for all the graphical aspect of the game. I am looking forward adding 2 difficulties in addition to the current one which could be associated to an intermediate difficulty. I also desire to add a way for the player to keep track of where the mines are located.
